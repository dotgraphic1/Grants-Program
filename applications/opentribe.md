## Project Overview ðŸ“„

### Overview
Opentribe aims to become a discovery platform where users can explore Grants, Bounties, Jobs, Tools, and Educational material for the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem, all under one roof.

Opentribe aims to become a discovery platform where users can explore Grants, Bounties, Jobs, Tools, and Educational material for the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem, all under one roof.

The platform will be divided into two main categories:

1. **Earn:** This section will include:
   - Grants from all parachains
   - Bounties: Bite-sized tasks for freelancers
   - Jobs from all parachains

2. **Build:** This section will feature:
   - Tools for the Polkadot ecosystem
   - Educational resources for the Polkadot ecosystem

Our project relates to the Polkadot ecosystem by providing a centralized hub for opportunities and resources, making it easier for developers, creators, and companies to connect and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem.

We will create designs based on the provided screenshots, adapting them to specific components. The UI will feature:

1. A clean, modern interface with a dark theme option
2. Separate sections for Earn (Grants, Bounties, Jobs) and Build (Tools, Learn)
3. Filtering and search functionality for each section
4. User profiles with the ability to showcase skills and past work
5. A dashboard for sponsors to manage their listings
6. Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project fits into the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem by providing a centralized platform for discovering opportunities and resources. This addresses several needs:

1. It simplifies the process of finding grants, bounties, and jobs for developers and creators.
2. It provides a unified place for projects and companies to list opportunities, increasing visibility.
3. It creates a hub for educational resources and tools, making it easier for newcomers to learn about and contribute to the ecosystem.

The target audience includes:
- Developers looking for opportunities in the Polkadot ecosystem
- Projects and companies seeking talent or offering grants
- Newcomers to the ecosystem looking for educational resources
- Anyone interested in discovering tools and libraries for Polkadot development

While there are similar platforms in other ecosystems (like SuperTeam for Solana), Opentribe will be tailored specifically to the needs of the Polkadot community.
